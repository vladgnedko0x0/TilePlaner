# TilePlanner
A simplified derivative of xTiles

This is a diploma prooject meant to create a simplified clone/derivative of xTiles.

Project's official name is WayDo.

The main difference is specialization towards trip planning.

Otherwise, basic functionality follows the same purpose as that of xTiles - create tiles with information in them to plan your future work.
